## About
This project simulates a bee hive, represented in two views: an inner view of the hive, where one can hover over any bee to see what type of bee it is, as well as an outer view of the hive in its surrounding environment. This view offers a few different ways to interact with the hive: plant flowers that bees can pollinate, change the temperature of the environment, and add pesticides to the flowers. Performing any of these interactions impacts the overall health of the bee colony.
